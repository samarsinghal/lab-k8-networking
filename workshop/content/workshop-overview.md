### K8 Networking

The Kubernetes Networking series consists of the following topics:

Kubernetes Networking, you will use different ways to control traffic on a Kubernetes cluster with Service types, Ingress, Gateways, Service Mesh, Network Policy and Calico.

## Next steps 

Continue your learning by visiting the [Istio workshop]. With Istio, you can manage network traffic, load balance across microservices, enforce access policies, verify service identity, and more.

We will also look at different use cases to explore Ingress Vs Gateway Vs Istio Service Mesh
